    <h1><span>Team works</span></h1>
    <p>
        <dl>
    I am proud of being member of some fabulous clubs, such as :
            <dt style:"background-color=#20bcd5">Freeways</dt>
    <dd>
        my participation in the robotics and high level programming departments changed my perspective of the IT and
        allowed me to acquire many hardSkills & softSkills it's an advantageous experience that I am deeply committed
        to, In this short period in the club I have participated (and I participate) in many competitions, events and
        workshops, and I am going to list just a few of them :
        <ul>
            <li>robotics competition: working with a team on a robot using Arduino Uno it's a super rich and funny
                experience</li>
            <li>seven days coding: this problem solving contest is a very important opportunity to boot mind's
                potentials, I Loved It SO Much!</li>
            <li>ISI CPC: being a part of the Organizing Committee of this great event boosts my organizing and
                team-working skills</li>
            <li>Fight corona: I am proud to have participated in this UTM competition and to create with my team a platform 
                to help people fight against the COVID-19. Which is one of the 15 projects accepted for funding.
                consequently, we were invited by ISI to participate in a similar competition proposed by the AUF 
                (Agence universitaire de la Francophonie)</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt style:"background-color=#20bcd5">ArtBox isi</dt>
    <dd>
        It is so amazing to be part of these artistic family I assisted on so many workshops and events:
        <ul>
            <li>the theatre workshop: it was incredibly amazing to discover a lot of my hidden capacities</li>
            <li>drawing workshops: I have never felt as creative as in these sessions</li>
            <li>digital design workshops: I loved how tools like PaintTool SAI, Ps, GIMP... could make our
                imaginations digital</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt style:"background-color=#20bcd5">Change Makers</dt>
    <dd>
        It is an opportunity to remain enthusiastic in the face of new challenges we are working on :
        <ul>
            <li>Deep learning</li>
            <li>Cyber Security</li>
            <li>IoT ...</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt style:"background-color=#20bcd5">the Mourouj-2 high school scout team</dt>
    <dd>
        helping society with its problems and improving our school was a blessing we work on many fields such as
        <ul>
            <li>Afforestation</li>
            <li>Cleaning Campaigns</li>
